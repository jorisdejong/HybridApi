# HybridApi
A set of functions that I regularly use. They are designed to be included in a project using Juce. 

For most people, ResXmlParser will be the most interesting. It contains functions 
- to get the locations of the various xml files that Resolume uses
- functions to extract useful data out of these files, for instance
 * comp name
 * comp resolution
 * slice info
 * clip info
 * clip thumbnails
 * osc ip and port
